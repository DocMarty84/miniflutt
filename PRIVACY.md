# Privacy Policy

Miniflutt doesn't collect any private information of any kind. The app doesn't perform any
tracking of the device and doesn't send any information to any third-party service. No ads, no
tracking, no 'anonymous bug report'. Nothing.

In order to work, Miniflutt requires the URL and the API key of your Miniflux server. This
information is stored locally and is solely used to connect to your own server. This information
is never sent or backed up to any third-party service.

Miniflutt needs an optional access to files and media on your device. This is used to save
attachments (images, videos, documents...) in your device's 'download' folder. If this access is
denied, attachments are saved in Miniflutt's data directory. Miniflutt doesn't list or read
your personal files. Obviously, no information is sent to any third-party service.

Miniflutt is a free and open-source app made on my free time. I'm not interested in your private
information at all.
